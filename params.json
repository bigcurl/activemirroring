Full self updating copys of dynamic websites.\r\n\r\nThis repository is git flow enabled (default settings).\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nProxies simply pass traffic through to the original site. The do not have any data from the original site. If the original sites goes down, all proxies go as well. ActiveMirroring takes the thought of free data to the next level by decentralizing the data behind the original site.\r\n\r\nActiveMirroring is a way to replace the central server which holds all data with a p2p way of accessing data. ActiveMirroring tries to fill that hole with lots of proxies that have the database local but are in sync with all other proxies. If a new proxy joins it receives a copy of the actual database. After that all changes that happen on any proxy are shared with the other proxies.\r\nThis way the data is decentralized.\r\n\r\nIt is a work in progress.\r\nIt might take a long time to get the problem solved.\r\nDo not get excited.\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n\r\nGet a prototyp running that solves the basic problems of\r\n  proxies need to know about each other for syncronisation\r\n  syncing local changes with the other proxies\r\n  uploading data to a proxy\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that things are getting interesting\r\n  how to represent user accounts in a decentralized environment?\r\n  how to detect bad proxies?\r\n  how to deal with upload flodding?\r\n  should each server have the full data or only a part?\r\n\r\n  ... more stuff will come up\r\n\r\n## Part of my PhD-Thesis\r\n\r\nThis code is part of my PhD-Thesis: A longterm storage strategy for the cultural heritage of the Federal Republic of Germany\r\n\r\nIt is an explorative sciences project which hopefully helps me gain some new ideas on how to tacle the problem of storing digital culture for future generations.
